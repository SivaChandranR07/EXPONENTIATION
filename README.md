# Find the exponentiation of a number

## Aim:
To write a program to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
### Step 1: 
Get the input from the user.
### Step 2:
Use exponentiation operator to find the exponentiation of a number.

## Program:
```python

#Program to to find the Exponentiation of a number.

#Developed by: Siva Chandran R
#RegisterNumber: 22005531


s1=int(input())
s2=int(input())
c=s1**s2
print("Exponentiation of a given number:",c)







```

## Output:
